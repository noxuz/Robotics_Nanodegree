# roboticsnanodegree
Final project from the robotics nanodegree at udacity
It consists of a mobile robot performing autonomous navigation,
localizing itself with the acml algorithm, in a map generated with the help of the gmapping ROS package. 

The robot is targeted to pick an object in a location on the map, and then dropping it at a defined location, these points are published by the pick_objects node.
